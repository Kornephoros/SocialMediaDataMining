To use, clone this repository and create your own Facebook Developers Application. Then, inside of your local copy, create 
a file called "fb_appinfo.py". Here, set a constant called FACEBOOK_APP_ID to be a string representation of
your Facebook Application ID. Another constant, "FACEBOOK_SECRET_ID" should be set to a string representation of your
Facebook Application's secret ID. The program should work now.
